Unit 1 - The Basics
	- Azure is a HTTP based service for hosting Web apps, Rest APIs and Mobile Backends 
  	- Features include the ability to scale the system based on the project requirements, whether they grow or shrink.
	- Up/Down -> This is based on your system requirements, like RAM, Storage, CPU
      	- Out/In -> The ability to increase or decrease the number of machine instances running your project

  	- Continuous Integration/Deployment support
      		- Out-of-the-box integration and deployment with Azure DevOps, Github, BitBucket, FTP 
      		- Connect using any of the above and App services will do the rest to auto-sync and deploy any changes

	- Deployment slots
		- Deployment slots are different from the default production slots - they are live apps with their host names
		- This goes alongside the production slot where people work on features, bugs and improvements to the application.

	- App Services on Linux
		- Apps can be hosted natively on Linius, but they also require that it works on Linux too 
			- This is done by running it in a custom Linux container (also known as a Web App Container)
		- Supported languages and frameworks include Node.js, Java (JRE 8 & JRE 11), PHP, Python, .NET, and Ruby.
			- The language versions are updated alongside your repositories whenever you need it
