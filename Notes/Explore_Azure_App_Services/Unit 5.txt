Unit 5 - Azure App Service Networking Features
	Default Behavior
		- Accessibility: By default, apps in App Service are accessible directly over the internet and can reach internet-hosted endpoints.

		Deployment Types
		1. Multitenant Public Service:
			- Hosts App Service plans in Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, and PremiumV3 pricing SKUs.

		2. Single-Tenant App Service Environment (ASE):
			- Hosts Isolated SKU App Service plans directly in your Azure virtual network.

	Multitenant App Service Networking Features
		- Roles:
			- Front Ends: Handle incoming HTTP or HTTPS requests.
			- Workers: Host the customer workload.

		- Network Structure:
			- Multitenant network; can't directly connect to your network.

		- Inbound Features:
			- App-assigned address
			- Access restrictions
			- Service endpoints
			- Private endpoints

		- Outbound Features:
			- Hybrid Connections
			- Gateway-required virtual network integration
			- Virtual network integration

	Inbound Use Cases
		- Examples of Inbound Use Cases:
			- Support IP-based SSL needs for your app
			- Support unshared dedicated inbound address for your app
			- Restrict access to your app from a set of well-defined addresses

		- Corresponding Features:
			- App-assigned address
			- Access restrictions

	Default Networking Behavior
		- Scale Units:
			- Support many customers in each deployment.
			- Free and Shared SKU plans use multitenant workers.
			- Basic and higher plans use dedicated workers for one App Service plan.

		- Outbound Addresses:
			- Different VM types for different plans.
			- Change in VM family results in different outbound addresses.

		- Worker VMs:
			- Broken down by App Service plans.	

	Finding Outbound IPs
		- Properties in Azure Portal:
			- Outbound IP addresses used by your app are listed in the app's properties.

		- Azure CLI Commands:
			- To find outbound IP addresses:
			bash 
			az webapp show --resource-group <group_name> --name <app_name> --query outboundIpAddresses --output tsv

			- To find all possible outbound IP addresses:
			bash
			az webapp show --resource-group <group_name> --name <app_name> --query possibleOutboundIpAddresses --output tsv
