Unit 2 - Key Components
	1 - Attributes Defined by the Plan
		- Operating System: (e.g., Windows, Linux)
	   	- Region: (e.g., West US, East US)
	   	- Number of VM Instances
	   	- Size of VM Instances: (e.g., Small, Medium, Large)
   		- Pricing Tier: (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, PremiumV3, Isolated, IsolatedV2)
	
	2 - Pricing Tier
	   	- Shared Compute: Free and Shared tiers; share resources on the same Azure VM.
	   	- Dedicated Compute: Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, and PremiumV3; run apps on dedicated Azure VMs.
		- Isolated: Isolated and IsolatedV2; run dedicated Azure VMs on Azure Virtual Networks.
		- Note: Shared tiers are for development and testing purposes.
	
	3 - App Running and Scaling
		- Free and Shared Tiers:
	  	- Run on shared VM instances with CPU quotas.
	  	- Can't scale out.
	
	4 - Other Tiers:
	  	- Apps run on all VM instances configured in the App Service plan.
	  	- Multiple apps in the same plan share the same VM instances.
	  	- Deployment slots and additional features (logs, backups, WebJobs) also use CPU and memory on these VM instances.
	
	5 - App Service Plan as the Scale Unit:
	  	- If configured for five VM instances, all apps in the plan run on all five instances.
	  	- Autoscaling settings apply to all apps in the plan.
	
	6 - Scaling and Capabilities
		- Scaling Up and Down:
		- Change the pricing tier of the App Service plan.
	  	- Apps in the same plan can share resources, but consider capacity and expected load.
	
	7 - Isolate the App into a New Plan When:
	  	- The app is resource-intensive.
	  	- Independent scaling from other apps is required.
	  	- The app needs resources in a different geographical region.
	
	8 - Benefits:
	  	- Allocate a new set of resources.
  		- Gain greater control over the app's performance.
