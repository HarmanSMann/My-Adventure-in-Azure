Unit 4 - Authentication and Authorization in Azure App Service

Overview
	- Built-in Support: Azure App Service offers built-in authentication and authorization to streamline user sign-in and data access for web apps, RESTful APIs, mobile backends, and Azure Functions.
	- Reasons to Use Built-in Authentication:
	- Time and Effort Saving: Minimizes the need for extensive code in your application.
	- Out-of-the-Box Features: Supports federated identity providers for seamless integration.
	- Flexibility: Allows integration with multiple login providers, such as Azure AD, Facebook, Google, Twitter.

Identity Providers
	- App Service uses federated identity with various providers, including:
	- Microsoft Identity Platform
	- Facebook
	- Google
	- Twitter
	- Any OpenID Connect provider
	- GitHub
	- Each provider has a designated sign-in endpoint for user authentication.

How It Works
	- Authentication and Authorization Module:
	- Operates in the same sandbox as application code.
	- Handles user authentication, token validation, session management, and identity injection into HTTP request headers.
	- Configurable via Azure Resource Manager settings or a configuration file.
	- No need for SDKs, specific programming languages, or changes to application code.

	- Authentication Flow:
	- Without Provider SDK:
	- Server-directed flow.
	- App Service manages federated sign-in.
	- With Provider SDK:
	- Client-directed flow.
	- Application code manages user sign-in using the provider's SDK.

	- Steps in Authentication Flow:
	- Sign user in.
	- Post-authentication.
	- Establish authenticated session.
	- Serve authenticated content.

Authorization Behavior
	- Configurable in Azure Portal:
	- Allow Unauthenticated Requests:
	- Defers authorization to application code.
	- Provides flexibility for handling anonymous requests.
	- Require Authentication:
	- Rejects unauthenticated traffic.
	- Can redirect to configured identity providers.
	- Caution: Restricting access applies to all calls, which might be undesirable for publicly available home pages in some applications.

Token Store
	- Built-in Token Store:
		- Repository of tokens associated with users.
		- Immediately available when authentication is enabled with any provider.

Logging and Tracing
	- Application Logging:
	- Authentication and authorization traces collected in log files.
	- Conveniently troubleshoot authentication errors by examining application logs.
