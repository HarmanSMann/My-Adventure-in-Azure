Creating an Instance
1 - Create a Directory: mkdir htmlapp
2 - Move to that Directory: cd htmlapp
3 - Clone Git repo: 
  git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/html-docs-hello-world.git
4 Set a Custom Name with azure and assign a resource Group:
  resourceGroup=$(az group list --query "[].{id:name}" -o tsv) appName=az204app$RANDOM

"This command creates two variables in the Azure CLI. The first variable `resourceGroup` is assigned the output of the command `az group list --query "[].{id:name}" -o tsv`. This command lists all the resource groups in your subscription and returns their names. The `--query` parameter specifies that we want to extract only the `id` field from each resource group and return it as a tab-separated value. The `-o tsv` parameter specifies that we want to output the result as a tab-separated value.
The second variable `appName` is assigned a string value of `az204app$RANDOM`. Here, `$RANDOM` is a shell variable that generates a random integer between 0 and 32767. The resulting string will be in the format `az204app<random_number>`. This command can be used to create a unique name for an Azure resource, such as an app service or storage account.

5 - Move to repo folder: cd html-docs-hello-world
6 - Generate a live deployment: az webapp up -g $resourceGroup -n $appName --html

"
This command deploys a web app to Azure. The -g parameter specifies the name of the resource group that contains the web app. The $resourceGroup variable is used to reference the resource group name that was previously assigned. The -n parameter specifies the name of the web app. The $appName variable is used to reference the web app name that was previously assigned. The --html parameter specifies that the web app should be deployed with HTML support.
Please note that this command assumes that you have already created a web app and a resource group in your Azure subscription. If you havenâ€™t done so already, you will need to create these resources before running this command.
